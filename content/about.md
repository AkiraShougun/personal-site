I'm a math student with a particular interest in number theory. Especially automorphic forms and the Langlands program. I love diving into the deep, abstract side of math and exploring how different areas connect. I'm hoping to start a PhD in number theory sometime soon.

When I'm not doing math, you'll probably find me at the piano, either playing or composing music. I also enjoy learning foreign languages and doing some programming on the sideâ€”basically anything that lets me explore patterns and structures in different ways.

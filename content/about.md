I'm a mathematics student at **University of Windsor**, mainly interested in **number theory**. My focus is on automorphic forms and the representation theory related to them. I’m especially drawn to how automorphic forms come up in a lot of places in mathematics. Especially their essential role in the Langlands program. 

I also spend time on **recreational math**, exploring curious problems, patterns, and puzzles. I like finding intuitive ways to present these ideas and share them with a broader audience through blog posts, visual explanations, or small creative projects that make math feel playful and accessible.

Outside of mathematics, I compose music and play the piano. I’m passionate about languages and currently speak four fluently, with an interest in learning more over time.

I’m aiming to continue into graduate studies and research, with a long-term interest in both theoretical work and mathematical exposition.
